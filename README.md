## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- vanilla javaScript


### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to create a hamburger menu using only vanilla JavaScript. I also gained valuable experience in configuring node-sass, a node server, and browser-sync. Another important lesson was understanding the good practice of adding `node_modules` to `.gitignore`. This project also enhanced my understanding of responsiveness in web design.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on developing my JavaScript skills and gradually explore how this code would be implemented in TypeScript.
